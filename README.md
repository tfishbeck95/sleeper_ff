# Huddle

A responsive, read-only fantasy football command center for Sleeper leagues. Huddle combines a polished React dashboard, an authenticated API, scheduled synchronization, a typed Sleeper client, shared business rules, and durable local storage.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The API runs at `http://localhost:4000` and uses the development bearer token `demo-token`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — run the API and web app together.
- `npm run build` — build every workspace.
- `npm test` — run domain and API tests.
- `npm run typecheck` — type-check every workspace.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to customize local configuration. See [`docs/product-scope.md`](docs/product-scope.md) for product boundaries and [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for system design.
